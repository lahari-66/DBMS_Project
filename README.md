The project is built using PHP for backend logic, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and MySQL as the database.

## Technologies Used
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, Font Awesome (for icons)
- *Backend*: PHP
- *Database*: MySQL
- *Web Server*: Apache (or any PHP-compatible server)
- *JavaScript*: For smooth scrolling and dynamic features (e.g., total value calculation)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishikesh10925/REMA.git
   

2. *Set Up the Database*:
   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., rema_db) using phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI.
   - Import the database schema (create tables like properties, users, transactions, development_requests, messages, etc., based on the project requirements). If no SQL file is provided, define tables as per the PHP scripts.
   - Update config.php with your database credentials:
     php
     <?php
     $dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=rema_db;charset=utf8mb4";
     $username = "";
     $password = "";
     $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
     $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
     ?>
     

3. *Configure the Server*:
   - Install a PHP-enabled web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP).
   - Place the REMA folder in your web server’s root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).

4. *Access the Application*:
   - Start your web server and MySQL service.
   - Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost/REMA/.
   - Log in using credentials set up in your database (default credentials may need to be added manually).

## Usage
1. *Login*: Access the main dashboard (dashboard.php) and log in as a buyer, seller, or agent.
2. *Buyer Dashboard*:
   - Use the search form to find properties.
   - Buy properties and track purchases/development status.
   - Chat with sellers for negotiations.
3. *Seller Dashboard*:
   - List new properties with detailed information.
   - Manage existing listings and respond to buyer requests.
   - View and reply to messages from buyers.
4. *Agent Dashboard*:
   - Add development services and handle buyer requests.
   - Buy or sell properties on behalf of clients.
5. *Navigation*: Click in-page links (e.g., "Search," "Properties," "History" for buyers; "List Property," "Requests," "Messages" for sellers) to jump to sections.

## Customization & Configuration
- *Styling*: Modify the inline CSS in each dashboard file to adjust the look and feel.
- *Functionality*: Extend PHP scripts to add features like email notifications, advanced analytics, or payment integration.
- *Database*: Add new tables or fields (e.g., for additional property attributes) and update queries accordingly.
- *JavaScript*: Enhance interactivity (e.g., form validation, live search) by adding more scripts.
